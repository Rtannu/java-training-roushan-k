1. Tell me about yourself.

I currently work at XXXXX as a Java full stack developer, bringing 9 years of professional experience in the field.
Throughout my career, I have built a strong expertise in developing secure, reliable, and scalable distributed systems, microservices,
and web services using the latest Java technologies and following agile methodologies.
My focus has been on ensuring high availability, low latency, and optimal performance across different internet access devices.

As a full-stack developer, I have utilized Java for backend development and leveraged various frameworks, such as React JS and visualization libraries,
to create interactive dashboards and front-end interfaces.
I have worked with technologies including JEE, Spring, Spring Boot, Apache Kafka, Hibernate, Maven, SQL, NoSQL, JSP, JDBC,
HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Angular, GIT, and CI/CD tools for efficient deployment processes.
Additionally, I have extensive experience in utilizing AWS services for infrastructure setup and deployment operations,
along with setting up application hosting environments in different environments.

Throughout my career, I have actively participated in troubleshooting production issues and
have a proven track record of analyzing, designing, and implementing effective solutions.

2. Tell me about your recent project.
I have experience working on the Client Transfer Application (CTA), an internal application designed to facilitate various types of money transfer transactions
including ACH, checks, wires, and journals. The application is built as an intranet using Angular for the user interface, providing separate screens for each
transaction type to be utilized by field officers, financial advisors, and bank specialists.

In the backend, we implemented microservices for handling different transaction types, and these services are hosted on the cloud.
We utilized AWS and used relational database instances, specifically SQL Server, for data storage. Additionally,
we incorporated Redis cache in front of our databases to efficiently handle read operations.
For separation of concerns, we employed separate database instances for read and write operations.

To ensure scalability and availability, we hosted our microservices on an auto scaling group within AWS.
Each microservice has its own scaling policies defined as auto scaling group policies in JSON format, allowing for automatic scaling in and out of
instances based on demand.
